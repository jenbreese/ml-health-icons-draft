#DRAFT - A healthcare icon library
This is a draft of an icon library. In the current state, these are *not approved* for ML projects.

#Instructions
Open *demo.html* to see a list of all the glyphs in your font along with their codes/ligatures.

To use the generated font in desktop programs, you can install the TTF font. In order to copy the character associated 
with each icon, refer to the text box at the bottom right corner of each glyph in demo.html. The character inside this 
text box may be invisible; but it can still be copied.

You won't need any of the files located under the *demo-files* directory when including the generated font in your 
own projects.

You can import *selection.json* back to the IcoMoon app using the *Import Icons* button (or via Main Menu > Manage Projects) 
to retrieve your icon selection.

To use in a website, include the font files and update your CSS to include the glyphs' classes. Review *style.css* to 
see the classs  you would need. /demo-files/demo.css is to render the *demo.html* file.
